# Calculatormon-CE
A pokemon game for the ti-84 plus ce

The game mostly uses gen 1 pokemon and mechanics. The pokemon sprites are from gen 2 and the map sprites are from firered and leafgreen

Controls: 2nd is A, clear is B, enter opens the menu

Put every file in the download folder on your calculator to play. It requires the Ti-84 plus CE C libraries to run (they are in the download folder). The game needs about 125 kb of RAM to run, so make sure you archive as many other programs as possible.


The tools folder includes some python scripts I made to help generate game data (move list, maps, and pokemon stats)
