A pokemon game for the ti-84 plus ce

The game mostly uses gen 1 pokemon and mechanics. The pokemon sprites are from crystal and the map sprites are from firered and leafgreen. Menu sprites are based off of firered and leafgreen but I had to modify them because of a different screen size.

Controls: 2nd is A, clear is B, enter opens the menu. In the menu, enter will move a pokemon or a move to the top.

Put every .8xv or .8xp file on your calculator to play. It requires the Ti-84 plus CE C libraries to run (they are in the download folder). The game needs a lot of RAM to run (I have not calculated the exact value), so make sure you archive as many other programs as possible.


The tools folder includes some python scripts I made to help generate game data (move list, maps, and pokemon stats)
